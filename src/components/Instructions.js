      <p>This site was created to commemorate National Poetry Month. Each poem begins with the opening line of a classic poem. Patrons may then contribute lines until the poem is ten lines long, at which point it will be added to the archives and a new poem will be started with a new opening line.</p>
      <p>We ask that patrons contribute only one to two lines per poem. Hover your mouse over the line to see the name of the author.</p>
      <p>At the end of the month a pdf zine will be created from the collected poems. The zine will be available at the Reed Memorial Library <a href="http://carmellibrary.org/">website</a>.</p>
